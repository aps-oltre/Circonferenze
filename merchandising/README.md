# üòç Merchandising

Merchandising production is differentiated in [printing on paper](paper.md) (producing flyers and posters) and [printing on fabric or on objects](swag.md) (producing swag such as shirts, tote bags, or mugs).

In both cases, the steps to follow are the same.

1. ****[**Graphic(s) creation**](../en/design/graphic-creation-workflow.md): conceiving the illustration and/or the writing to be printed on the products
2. **Producers‚Äô scouting**: looking for those who could practically produce the merchandising. They can be either the same entity (e.g. a print shop that gets its own t-shirts) or separate entities:
   1. raw material: the producer of the simple material (e.g. shirt, mug, hoodie‚Ä¶)
   2. print shop: the store that would print the graphics on the raw material
3. ****[**Printing**](./#printing)****
4. **Distributing**: as an [_APS_](../associazione/), we cannot print any invoice, therefore we are <mark style="color:red;">not allowed to sell anything</mark>. Nevertheless, in order to earn funds out of merchandising, we perform the little trick of gifting merchandise for free in exchange for donations.

**NOTE**: steps 1 and 2 should be carried out at the same time, by [the Peacocks](../staff/teams.md#civette) and [the Owls](../staff/teams.md#civette) respectively. This is important both to be efficient in terms of timing, but above all to allow the designers to communicate with the print shop concerning peculiar intentions (e.g. printing a writing on a sleeve of hoodies, defining the kind of printing material‚Ä¶)
