Scambi Festival’s color palette was born quite randomly by Miranda’s drawing experiments.

Below, the HEX values for the colors in the palette, placed in a CSS root in order to be readily used.

```CSS
:root {
  --white-ish: #F5EAD7;
  --light-blue: #3A83B7;
  --orange: #E2A05A;
  --purple: #69088D;
  --deep-purple: #1B004D;
  --lavanda: #514A9C;
}
```
