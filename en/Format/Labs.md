# ðŸ§ª Labs

Laboratories are the heart of Scambi Festival.

They are activities planned to *involve* the public in discussions, artistic productions, games and anything that requires active participation. In our laboratories we do not have stages nor borders, and the coordinators (*labbers*) continously engage with the public. This is what makes the lab a special and unique experience.

Each one of us can (and should!) share their own ideas on our Telegram group *Scambidee*. All advices will be taken into consideration as they represent the vital nourishment of Scambi: the festival is created by us, and it reflects the interests and passions of each one of us. Crazy, impossible, inconclusive ideas are more than welcome, nothing is rejected, but it is only set aside for future occasions.
