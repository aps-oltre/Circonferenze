# üçç Pigna

_Pigna_ (translated ‚Äúpine cone‚Äù) is the old town of Sanremo, founded around the year 1000. It has been continuously inhabited since 1500. It is a district perched over the current city center and it is Scambi Festival‚Äôs wonderland.

Realizing the festival in this neighborhood is a crucial and extremely meaningful choice, because it entails several challenges:

* there is **no road open to vehicles**: there are only three point of accessible by car, but the whole neighborhood is entirely pedestrian
* **accessibilty is awful**: taken as it is, it is almost impossible to arrive anywhere without having to climb stairs
* it is very **little known**; thanks to the commitment of the inhabitants, of new commercial activities and of cultural associations such as _Pigna Mon Amour_, with which we collaborate actively, Pigna has experienced an amazing renaissance compared to some years ago, however there are still some big obstacles to be overcome.

If you have never been there, this video shows its most characteristic spots:
