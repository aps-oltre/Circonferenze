# ü§å Language

Following the principles of inclusiveness and mutual respect on which Scambi is based, the language we use for our communications, both formal and informal, is _**inclusive**_** Italian** (or inclusive English).

{% hint style="info" %}
Actually, the term ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù is not inclusive at all (Sabrina in particular despises it), as including someone means that you are automatically excluding someone else, however, we keep using ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù since it is the most understandable and straightforward term.
{% endhint %}

Practically, this means using **they/them** when referring to a general person, but it doesn't stop there.

The UN general guidelines for gender-inclusive language are a good starting point to give you an idea: [https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml](https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml)
