# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ¦½ Jaybirds

The Jaybirds team deals with making the festival accessible in many ways. During the 2021 edition, unfortunately, participation of  disabled people has not been registered; therefore during these months we have tried to contact different local and national organizations, in order to involve them, however the results have been inexistent.&#x20;

We are working hard so that the 2022 festival will be accessible and inclusive for everyone. To do so, we are organizing an inspection to verify the accessibility of the Pigna district and we are also working in order to open traineeship positions for future LIS interpreters (on this topic, further updates will come)&#x20;
