# ðŸ‘• Merchandising

Creating merchandising is something very standard to do, yet it does not mean that it is easy or that it is not costly in terms of money and time. In this page there are some information in order to make merch printing as effortless as possible.

The steps to perform are:

1. **Graphic(s) creation**: conceiving the illustration and/or the writing to be printed on the products
2. **Producersâ€™ scouting**: looking for those who could practically produce the merchandising. They can be either the same entity (e.g. a print shop that gets its own t-shirts) or separate entities:
   1. raw material: the producer of the simple material (e.g. shirt, mug, hoodieâ€¦)
   2. print shop: the store that would print the graphics on the raw material
3. **Printing**
4. **Distributing**: as an [APS](associazione/), we cannot print any invoice, therefore we are not allowed to directly sell anything. Nevertheless, in order to earn funds out of merchandising, we perform the little trick of gifting merchandise for free in exchange for donations.

Note that steps 1 and 2 should be carried out at the same time, by [the Peacocks](<README (1).md#civette>) and [the Owls](<README (1).md#civette>) respectively. This is important both to be efficient in terms of timing, but above all to allow the designers to communicate with the print shop concerning peculiar intentions (e.g. printing a writing on a sleeve of hoodies, defining the kind of printing materialâ€¦)

## Printed
