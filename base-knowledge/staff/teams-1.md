# ðŸ’‘ Teams

The staff is divided into workgroups, or _teams_. Each team deals with a specific field within Scambi Festival. Teams work separately, they have atheir own chat in order to communicate and they organize their own meetings (metto link) independently.&#x20;

The members of each group (actually, the team of which each associate is part) are specified in the _Libro Soci_ (associates register), which is available on _Pino_.

### Chameleons&#x20;

The Chameleons make up the **board** of [A.P.S Oltre](../../associazione/). They are the team, that takes on the legal responsability of the decisions taken and it has the last word on **important** questions, such as **money questions** and choices having long-term repercussions. The board is directed by the president of the association.&#x20;

### Owls&#x20;

The Owls deal with the logistic of the festival. They always know the answer to crucial questions:"who?", "what?", "how?", "where?". Basically, they find tables, rooms for the guests, sandwiches, and, when needed, also dinasours.&#x20;

### Dissolvenze (Fade-out)&#x20;

Strangely enough, Fade-out is the team that deals with _Dissolvenze_ (Fade-out), our section devoted to films, which announces and organizes the homonymous  short film contest.&#x20;
